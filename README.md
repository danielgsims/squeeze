SQUEEZE Plugin Framework
========================

A small collection of libraries for writing WordPress plugins. It's by no means a complete product. I'm just adding to it as I need new things.

I was tired of writing WordPress plugins that sucked. So I tried to write something that struck a balance between decently structured code and stay-out-of-my-way-osity. Whether I accomplished that is up to someone else to judge!

If you find this useful please let me know. If you've got a question, please let me know. If you want to contribute, I'd be stoked.
