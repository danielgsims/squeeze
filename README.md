SQUEEZE Plugin Framework
========================

Rapid WordPress plugin development using modern techniques and principles. I was tired of writing WordPress plugins that sucked. So I started writing Squeeze. Squeeze provides an MVC structure for plugin development, utilizing modern principles such as namespacing and autoloading, parameterized queries, object oriented data management and API access and more.

Squeeze is meant for software engineers. But more than that, Squeeze is meant for anyone who wants to rapidly develop maintainable, standards-based plugins for the most popular platform on earth.

If you've ever taken a freelance job working on a WordPress project, you may find Squeeze useful.

If you find this useful please let me know. If you've got a question, please let me know. If you want to contribute, I'd be stoked.
